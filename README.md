From crafting pixel-perfect user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building robust server-side logic using Node.js, I thrive on the challenge of bringing ideas to life in the digital realm. All projects were built, planed and designed from scratch 

### My tech stack includes:

Frontend: **`HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js`** 

Backend: **`Node.js, Express.js`**

Database: **`MongoDB`**

Tools: **`Git, VSCode`**
